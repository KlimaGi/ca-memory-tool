        When you increase your long-term memory, when you reach and go through a critical limit,
        then the wider creation process begins. You can understand much more
        things at the same time. It is beautiful to cross your limits. And here you are
        at the next level. Here everything is harder, yet.
        For me is interesting to find a way how can I improve my memory.
        What can I do more, that my understanding of things `(`code =`)`
        in my case`&rsquo;`, could be wider. I keep reading scientists`&apos;` research,
        and memory competition creators`&apos;` books. And still trying to
        adjust their best practice to my brain. And still trying to create a useful tool.
        At least one user will use that tool (it`&apos;`s me =).
        So let`&apos;`s see the work and research, and creation sequence.
        The most interesting part here is to create code logic for this.
